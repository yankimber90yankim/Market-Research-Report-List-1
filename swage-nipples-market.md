<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Swage Nipples Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Concentric</li><li>Eccentric</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Swage nipples are fittings used to connect different pipe sizes and are categorized into two primary types: concentric and eccentric. Concentric swage nipples have a uniform diameter, allowing for seamless transitions between pipes on the same axis. They are ideal for vertical piping applications. Eccentric swage nipples, on the other hand, have an offset design, facilitating a smoother flow of fluids and minimizing air pockets, making them suitable for horizontal installations. Both types play crucial roles in various piping systems.</p></p>
