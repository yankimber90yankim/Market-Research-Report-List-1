<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single Dose Radiotherapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Beam Radiotherapy</li><li>Internal Beam Radiotherapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Single Dose Radiotherapy market is primarily divided into two types: External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT) and Internal Beam Radiotherapy (IBRT). EBRT involves delivering high-energy beams, like X-rays, from outside the body to target tumors non-invasively. In contrast, IBRT, or brachytherapy, involves placing radioactive sources directly inside or near the tumor, allowing for a focused dose while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue. Both methods aim to optimize treatment efficiency and patient outcomes in cancer therapy.</p></p>
