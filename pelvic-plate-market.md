<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pelvic Plate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Locking</li><li>Non-Locking</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pelvic plate market is categorized into two main types: locking and non-locking plates. Locking plates feature screws that lock into the plate, providing enhanced stability and preventing screw loosening, making them ideal for complex fractures. Non-locking plates, on the other hand, rely on friction between the screw and the plate for stability, offering simplicity and cost-effectiveness. Both types serve distinct needs in orthopedic surgeries, with their choice depending on the fracture's nature and required fixation strength.</p></p>
