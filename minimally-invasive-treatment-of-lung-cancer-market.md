<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Minimally Invasive Treatment of Lung Cancer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lung Tumor Ablation</li><li>Lung Tumor Embolization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The minimally invasive treatment of lung cancer includes two key market types: lung tumor ablation and lung tumor embolization. Lung tumor ablation involves techniques like radiofrequency or microwave ablation, which destroy cancer cells using heat or energy without major surgery. Lung tumor embolization, on the other hand, involves the deliberate blockage of blood vessels supplying the tumor, depriving it of nutrients and oxygen, ultimately leading to tumor shrinkage. Both approaches aim to manage lung cancer effectively while minimizing recovery time and complications.</p></p>
