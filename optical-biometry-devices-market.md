<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Biometry Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-Contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical biometry devices are classified into two main types: contact and non-contact. Contact type devices require direct interaction with the eye, utilizing methods like applanation to measure parameters such as axial length and corneal curvature. In contrast, non-contact devices utilize light and imaging technology to obtain measurements without physical touch, enhancing patient comfort and reducing risks of infection. Both types are essential in optimizing ocular assessments, particularly in the fields of cataract surgery and refractive error corrections.</p></p>
